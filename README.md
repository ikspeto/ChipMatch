# ChipMatch
## An Android game created in LibGDX.



I started making this game in May 2014. It was mainly done as a way to test out the framework LibGDX which I had discovered recently. 
The 1.0 version was finished in August 2014. However, I made some minor modifications later on as well. The last change to the code was made in May 2015.

The code in its current form is probably impossible to compile because of its many dependencies to libraries which have drastically changed. However, I intend to upload a revised version which should have its basic functionality working soon.

Here are some screenshots of the game:

The point of the game is to keep the grid from filling up with chips, at which point you lose. You free up the board by putting together 4 of a kind.
There are two gameplay modes: Action and Relax. In the Relax mode new chips appear after every move, so you have as much time to think as you want.
On the other hand, in Action mode chips appear every few seconds so you have to play quickly in order to win.

The game also has some unlockable achievements and integration with Google Play Games Services.
